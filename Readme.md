# bluez-sbc-sys

### A very thin wrapper around the SBC codec contained in BlueZ version 4.86.0

I want to use bluetooth audio in my Microcontroller with rust,
but didn't find a good library.
So I ported this.

Might actually rewrite in rust at some point.

## Consider this code experimental and unmaintained

If I find time to maintain it, then I will, but don't rely on that.

Hope this helps in some way, even as just a learning exercise.

## See test for usage
